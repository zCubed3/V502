## Contributing
1) Feel free to fork and add missing features in your own fork, when you're ready begin a pull request and it'll be reviewed for merging!
2) Since the main core library is governed by the BSD-3 License, you're allowed to create your own private forks of the software and use it on your own, but I highly encourage you to contribute substantial feature additions if you've made any you'll want to share!
3) Have fun, don't stress about making changes and having them denied over nitpicks, unless you're adding in malicious or completely unnecessary code, we're fine with adding it to the project!
